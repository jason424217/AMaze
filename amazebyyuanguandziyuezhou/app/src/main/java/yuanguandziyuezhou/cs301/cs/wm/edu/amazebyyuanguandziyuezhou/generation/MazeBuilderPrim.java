/**
 * This class has the responsibility to create a maze of given dimensions (width, height)
 * together with a solution based on a distance matrix.
 * The MazeBuilder implements Runnable such that it can be run a separate thread.
 * The MazeFactory has a MazeBuilder and handles the thread management.

 *
 * The maze is built with a randomized version of Prim's algorithm.
 * This means a spanning tree is expanded into a set of cells by removing walls from the maze.
 * Algorithm leaves walls in tact that carry the border flag.
 * Borders are used to keep the outside surrounding of the maze enclosed and
 * to make sure that rooms retain outside walls and do not end up as open stalls.
